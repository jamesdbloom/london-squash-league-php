Hi All,

I am working on writing the code to auto manage the number of players in the divisions and promote and demote players.  Unfortunately this has taken longer than I expected. I have therefore extended the closing date for the current league until Jan 15th to give me time to complete this logic.

The next league will start by Jan 17th at the lastest.

The features that are currently under development and will be completed by the start of the next league are:
1. player ranking based on number of matches won and score in each match
2. players will be added to each division (promoted / demoted) based on their overall ranking
3. division will be created automatically based on the number of players so that player will be evenly distributed across division ensuring each division has a sensible number of players

I appreciate your patience while I get this new league site up and running in my personal time.

Thanks,

James Bloom
